Tie your cape on tight and hold onto your facemask, this is going to be a wild ride. The CAPiTA Defenders of Awesome Snowboard has been doing what it does for years now: turning local resort rippers into superheroes. CAPiTA s flagship shape returns unchanged for another circumnavigation of the sun, but with an updated Dual Blaster Ashpop Core to add just a bit more power. This trusty sidekick to all of your in-bounds antics is ready to take the leap (or spin, or slash, or butter) with you. So join the League of defenders already out there turning the resort into a safe haven for enthusiastic recreating. All that Awesome isn't going to defend itself.
